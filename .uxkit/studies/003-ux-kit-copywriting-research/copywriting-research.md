### Target Audiences
1. **Primary**: UX researchers using AI tools (Cursor IDE, Codex v2)
2. **Secondary**: Product teams wanting evidence-based decisions
3. **Tertiary**: Developers integrating research into workflows

## Copywriting Framework

### Core Messaging Hierarchy

#### Level 1: Value Proposition (Landing Page)
**"Empower deep UX research with AI-powered tools and structured data accumulation"**

#### Level 2: Key Benefits (Feature Pages)
- **Deep Research**: "Systematic investigation that builds knowledge over time"
- **AI Acceleration**: "Leverage AI tools to perform deeper research faster"
- **Data Accumulation**: "Build citable research artifacts that grow more valuable"
- **Evidence Building**: "Research data that supports future decisions"

#### Level 3: Supporting Details (Documentation)
- **How it works**: Technical implementation details
- **Why it matters**: Benefits and outcomes
- **What to do**: Clear action steps and workflows

## Page-Specific Copy Recommendations

### 1. Landing Page (README.md)

#### Current Issues
- Too much technical detail
- Unclear value proposition
- Weak call-to-action
- Missing emotional appeal

```

**Value Proposition:**
```
## ðŸŽ¯ What is UX-Kit?

UX-Kit is a research empowerment system that leverages AI tools like Cursor IDE to perform deeper, more systematic UX research. Instead of scattered research efforts, UX-Kit provides **structured research processes**, **AI-powered analysis**, and **citable data artifacts** that build knowledge over time.

**Perfect for:**
- UX researchers who want to perform deeper, more systematic research
- Teams using AI tools like Cursor IDE or Codex v2 for research acceleration
- Anyone who needs to accumulate and cite research data artifacts
- Teams building research-driven product decisions with evidence
```

**Benefits (Why UX-Kit?):**
```

# Why UX-Kit?

## The Research Empowerment Problem

### Shallow Research is Expensive

Most UX research teams struggle with:

- **Surface-Level Research** - Quick interviews and surveys that don't build deep understanding
- **Scattered Knowledge** - Research insights that don't accumulate or build upon each other
- **Uncitable Evidence** - Research data that can't be referenced or built upon
- **Manual Processes** - Time spent on research administration instead of deep investigation
- **Lost Context** - Important research patterns buried in unorganized data
```

**Solution:**
```
## The UX-Kit Research Empowerment Solution

### Deep Research by Design

UX-Kit transforms shallow research into systematic, evidence-based investigation:

- **Systematic Processes** - Research workflows that build knowledge over time
- **Data Accumulation** - Research artifacts that grow more valuable with each study
- **Citable Evidence** - Research data you can reference, cite, and build upon
- **Pattern Recognition** - Systematic data collection that reveals insights over time
```
