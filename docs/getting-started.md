# Getting Started with UX-Kit

## Welcome to Research Empowerment!

You're about to transform how you do UX research. This guide will get you up and running with a system that empowers deeper research and accumulates knowledge over time.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll:
- ✅ Have UX-Kit installed and configured
- ✅ Understand how to leverage AI tools for research acceleration
- ✅ Create your first research study with structured data accumulation
- ✅ Know how to build citable research artifacts
- ✅ Be ready to perform deeper, more systematic research

## Prerequisites

**You need:**
- Node.js 18 or higher ([Download here](https://nodejs.org))
- A terminal/command line
- 5 minutes of your time

**That's it!** No complex setup, no dependencies, no configuration files to manage.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install UX-Kit

```bash
npm install -g @ux-kit/cli
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

```bash
uxkit --help
```

You should see the UX-Kit help menu. If you get an error, check that Node.js is installed correctly.

## Your First Research Study

### Step 1: Initialize UX-Kit

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
uxkit init
```

This creates a `.uxkit/` directory with all the structure you need for systematic research and data accumulation.

### Step 2: Create a Study

```bash
uxkit study:create --name "My First Research Study"
```

UX-Kit will create a structured study directory designed to accumulate research data over time.

### Step 3: Explore What Was Created

```bash
uxkit study:list
```

You'll see your study listed with metadata and timestamps.

## Understanding the Research System

UX-Kit creates a systematic research environment that accumulates knowledge:

```
.uxkit/
├── config.yaml              # Your research configuration
├── templates/               # Research process templates
└── studies/                 # Your research studies
    └── my-first-research-study/
        ├── study-info.json  # Study metadata and context
        ├── questions.md     # Research questions and hypotheses
        ├── sources.md       # Research sources and references
        └── synthesis.md     # Research synthesis and evidence
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Knowledge Accumulation** - Each study builds upon previous research
- **Citable Artifacts** - Research data you can reference and build upon
- **Systematic Processes** - Research workflows that build knowledge over time
- **Evidence Building** - Research data that supports future decisions

## AI Integration for Research Acceleration

UX-Kit works beautifully with AI tools to accelerate your research processes. Choose your preferred setup:

### For Cursor IDE Users

```bash
uxkit init --aiAgent cursor
```

This creates custom slash commands in your IDE that accelerate research:
- `/specify` - Create research specifications and hypotheses
- `/research` - Generate research questions and analysis frameworks
- `/study` - Create research studies with systematic data collection
- `/synthesize` - Synthesize research insights and build evidence

### For Codex v2 Users

```bash
uxkit init --aiAgent codex
```

This sets up natural language prompts for research acceleration:
- "Create a research study for mobile app onboarding patterns"
- "Generate research questions about user checkout behavior"
- "Synthesize insights from last week's user interviews"
- "Analyze patterns in user feedback data"

### For Custom AI Tools

```bash
uxkit init --aiAgent custom
```

This gives you flexible templates and configuration options for any AI tool to accelerate your research processes.

## Your First Research Workflow

Now let's walk through a complete research workflow that builds knowledge:

### 1. Generate Research Questions

```bash
uxkit research:questions --study my-first-research-study --topic "How do users experience our checkout flow?"
```

This creates structured research questions that build upon previous research and accumulate knowledge.

### 2. Collect Research Sources

```bash
uxkit research:sources --study my-first-research-study
```

This helps you organize research sources and references that contribute to your knowledge base.

### 3. Process Interview Data

```bash
uxkit research:interview --study my-first-research-study --transcript "User interview content here..."
```

This processes interview transcripts with participant profiling, creating citable research artifacts.

### 4. Synthesize Insights

```bash
uxkit research:synthesize --study my-first-research-study
```

This creates a comprehensive synthesis with actionable recommendations and citable evidence.

## What Makes UX-Kit Different

### Traditional Research Approach
1. Conduct isolated research studies
2. Generate insights that don't accumulate
3. Repeat research on the same topics
4. Lose context and evidence over time
5. Make decisions without citable research

### UX-Kit Research Empowerment
1. Create systematic research studies
2. Accumulate research data that builds knowledge
3. Build upon previous research findings
4. Preserve context and evidence over time
5. Make decisions with citable research artifacts

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to learn new research methods?"
No! UX-Kit enhances your existing research methods with systematic data accumulation and AI acceleration.

### "Will this work with my existing research workflow?"
Yes! UX-Kit enhances your existing workflow by adding systematic data accumulation and AI acceleration.

### "What if I'm not technical?"
UX-Kit is designed for UX researchers, not developers. The commands are simple and the documentation is clear.

### "Can I customize the research processes?"
Absolutely! UX-Kit uses templates that you can customize to match your research methods and team needs.

## Success Tips

### Start with One Study
- Begin with one research study to get familiar with the system
- Focus on building citable research artifacts
- Don't try to migrate everything at once

### Use AI Integration
- AI integration is where UX-Kit really shines for research acceleration
- Start with the AI agent that matches your current tools
- Experiment with natural language prompts for research tasks

### Build Knowledge Over Time
- Focus on accumulating research data that builds knowledge
- Reference previous research in new studies
- Create citable artifacts that support future decisions

## Ready to Go?

You now have everything you need to start using UX-Kit for research empowerment. The best way to learn is by doing, so create your first study and explore how it accumulates knowledge over time.
