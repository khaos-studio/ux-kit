# UX-Kit Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Clean Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single responsibility
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Testability**: All components must be easily testable in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Code should be self-documenting and easy to modify

### 2. Protocol-Oriented Design
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Favor composition and protocols
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new implementations without modifying existing code
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's type system for compile-time safety

### 3. Test-Driven Development
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing tests first, make them pass, then refactor
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 90% code coverage for all production code
- **Test Quality**: Tests should be readable, maintainable, and fast
- **Continuous Testing**: Run tests on every change

### 4. Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enable all strict type checking options
- **ESLint Configuration**: Enforce consistent code style and catch errors
- **Prettier Integration**: Automatic code formatting
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all public APIs

### 5. Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: All CLI commands must respond within 2 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: Keep memory footprint under 100MB for typical operations
- **Scalability**: Support multiple concurrent research studies
- **Efficiency**: Optimize file I/O and AI agent communication

### 6. Security & Reliability
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with clear user feedback
- **Data Protection**: Secure handling of research data and configurations
- **Recovery**: Automatic recovery from transient failures

### 7. User Experience
- **Intuitive Commands**: Clear, consistent command syntax
- **Helpful Feedback**: Progress indicators and clear error messages
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive user and developer documentation
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience across macOS, Linux, and WSL

### 8. Extensibility
- **Plugin Architecture**: Support for future extensions and plugins
- **AI Agent Integration**: Easy integration with new AI providers
- **Storage Flexibility**: Support for different storage backends
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration system

## Development Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
- Create comprehensive specifications
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Plan test strategy
- Document architectural decisions

### 2. Implementation Phase
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Implement clean architecture layers
- Follow protocol-oriented design
- Maintain high code quality

### 3. Testing Phase
- Run full test suite
- Perform integration testing
- Test cross-platform compatibility
- Validate performance requirements

### 4. Documentation Phase
- Update API documentation
- Create user guides
- Document architectural decisions
- Provide examples and tutorials

## Quality Gates

### Code Review Requirements
- All code must be reviewed before merging
- Reviewers must verify architectural compliance
- Test coverage must meet minimum requirements
- Documentation must be updated

### Release Criteria
- All tests must pass
- Performance requirements must be met
- Documentation must be complete
- Security review must be completed
- Cross-platform testing must pass

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
- Monthly architecture reviews
- Quarterly performance assessments
- Annual security audits
- Continuous feedback incorporation

### Learning & Growth
- Stay updated with TypeScript best practices
- Research new testing methodologies
- Explore emerging AI integration patterns
- Share knowledge with the team

This constitution serves as the foundation for all development decisions and must be followed throughout the UX-Kit implementation.
