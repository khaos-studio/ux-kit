## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
Enable easy remote installation of the UX Kit CLI tool comparable to `brew install`, allowing users to install and set up the tool with a single shell script command. This will streamline the onboarding process and make the tool more accessible to new users.

### 1.2 Scope
- Create a shell installation script that can be executed remotely
- Support installation from private GitHub repository via SSH
- Automate dependency installation and environment setup
- Provide post-installation verification and configuration
- Support both macOS and Linux platforms
- Handle version management and updates

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Users can install UX Kit CLI with a single command: `curl -fsSL <install-url> | bash`
- Installation works seamlessly on systems with SSH access to private GitHub repo
- All dependencies are automatically resolved and installed
- Post-installation verification confirms successful setup
- Installation script handles errors gracefully with clear messaging
- Support for both latest stable and specific version installations

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 Architecture
- **Installation Script**: Standalone bash script that handles the complete installation process
- **Repository Access**: Leverage existing SSH configuration for private GitHub repository access
- **Package Management**: Integrate with system package managers (Homebrew on macOS, apt/yum on Linux)
- **Binary Distribution**: Distribute pre-compiled binaries for faster installation
- **Configuration Management**: Automated setup of user configuration and environment variables

### 2.2 Design Patterns
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component handles one aspect of installation
- **Fail-Fast**: Early validation and clear error messages
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times without side effects
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for different system configurations

### 2.3 Dependencies
- **System Requirements**: Node.js 18+, Git, SSH client
- **Package Managers**: Homebrew (macOS), apt/yum (Linux)
- **External Services**: GitHub API for releases, SSH for repository access
- **Build Tools**: TypeScript compiler, Jest for testing

### 2.4 Interfaces
- **Command Line Interface**: `curl -fsSL <url> | bash` for installation
- **GitHub API**: For fetching release information and binaries
- **SSH Protocol**: For accessing private repository
- **System Package Managers**: For dependency installation

# - Set up configuration and environment
# - Verify installation success
```

#### 3.1.2 System Detection Module

- Install Git if not present
- Install build tools if needed
- Handle different package managers (brew, apt, yum)

#### 3.1.4 Binary Installer
- Download pre-compiled binaries from GitHub releases
- Handle version selection (latest, specific version)
- Install to system PATH
- Set appropriate permissions

#### 3.1.5 Configuration Setup
- Create user configuration directory
- Set up environment variables
- Initialize default configuration files
- Configure SSH access if needed

### 3.2 Data Models

#### 3.2.1 System Information
```typescript
interface SystemInfo {
  os: 'macos' | 'linux';
  distribution?: string;
  architecture: 'x86_64' | 'arm64';
  nodeVersion?: string;
  gitVersion?: string;
  sshAvailable: boolean;
}
```

#### 3.2.2 Installation Options
```typescript
interface InstallOptions {
  version: 'latest' | string;
  installPath: string;
  skipDependencies: boolean;
  skipVerification: boolean;
  verbose: boolean;
}
```

# Install with options
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org/ux-kit/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-path /usr/local/bin --verbose
```

#### 3.3.2 GitHub API Integration
- Fetch latest release information
- Download binary assets
- Verify checksums and signatures
- Handle rate limiting and authentication

### 3.4 Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Permission Errors**: Clear instructions for sudo requirements
