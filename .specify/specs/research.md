# Research & Analysis: Remote Install Support

## Feature Requirements Analysis

### Core Requirements
- **Single Command Installation**: Users can install UX Kit CLI with `curl -fsSL <url> | bash`
- **SSH Integration**: Leverage existing SSH configuration for private GitHub repository access
- **Cross-Platform Support**: macOS and Linux compatibility
- **Automated Setup**: Dependency installation, configuration, and verification
- **Version Management**: Support for latest and specific version installations

### User Stories
1. **As a developer**, I want to install UX Kit CLI with a single command so I can quickly get started
2. **As a team lead**, I want the installation to work on different systems so my team can use it consistently
3. **As a DevOps engineer**, I want the installation to be idempotent so it's safe to run in automation
4. **As a security-conscious user**, I want the installation to verify checksums so I can trust the binaries

### Functional Requirements
- Detect operating system and architecture automatically
- Install required dependencies (Node.js, Git) if missing
- Download and install pre-compiled binaries from GitHub releases
- Set up configuration and environment variables
- Verify installation success with clear feedback
- Handle version selection (latest vs specific)
- Support custom installation paths

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Installation completes within 2 minutes
- **Reliability**: 99% success rate on supported platforms
- **Security**: Verify binary checksums and use HTTPS
- **Usability**: Clear error messages and progress indicators
- **Maintainability**: Shell script follows best practices

## Technical Constraints

### System Requirements
- **Node.js**: Version 18+ required
- **Git**: Required for repository access
- **SSH**: Required for private repository access
- **Package Managers**: Homebrew (macOS), apt/yum (Linux)

### Platform Limitations
- **Windows**: Not supported in initial version (PowerShell support planned)
- **Architecture**: x86_64 and ARM64 support required
- **Shell**: Bash 4.0+ required for script execution

### Security Constraints
- Must verify binary checksums before installation
- Use HTTPS for all downloads
- Validate SSH key fingerprints
- Sanitize user inputs and file paths
- Follow principle of least privilege

## Best Practices Research

### Shell Script Best Practices
- Use `set -e` for fail-fast behavior
- Implement proper error handling with `trap`
- Use `shellcheck` for code quality
- Provide clear progress indicators
- Support both interactive and non-interactive modes

### Installation Script Patterns
- **Idempotent Design**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for different systems
- **Fail-Fast**: Early validation with clear error messages
- **User Feedback**: Progress indicators and status messages

### Package Management Integration
- **Homebrew**: Use `brew install` for dependencies on macOS
- **APT**: Use `apt-get` for Ubuntu/Debian systems
- **YUM**: Use `yum` for RHEL/CentOS systems
- **Fallback**: Manual installation if package managers unavailable

### GitHub API Integration
- Use GitHub Releases API for binary downloads
- Implement rate limiting and retry logic
- Handle authentication for private repositories
- Verify release signatures and checksums

## Technical Challenges

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Different package managers on different systems
- Varying file system permissions and paths
- Different shell environments and capabilities
- Architecture-specific binary requirements

### Security Considerations
- Verifying binary authenticity and integrity
- Handling SSH key validation securely
- Protecting against malicious script injection
- Ensuring secure download and installation

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Permission problems
- Missing dependencies
- SSH configuration problems
- Version conflicts

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient binary downloads
- Minimal system resource usage
- Fast installation and startup times
- Optimized dependency resolution

## Research Conclusions

### Recommended Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Separate concerns for system detection, dependency management, and installation
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with clear user guidance
- **Security First**: Verify all downloads and validate system state
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback and progress indicators throughout

### Key Implementation Decisions
- Use bash for maximum compatibility
- Implement comprehensive system detection
- Create fallback mechanisms for dependency installation
- Provide detailed error messages and troubleshooting guidance
- Support both interactive and automated installation modes

### Success Metrics
- Installation success rate > 99%
- Average installation time < 2 minutes
- User satisfaction with error messages
- Cross-platform compatibility across supported systems
