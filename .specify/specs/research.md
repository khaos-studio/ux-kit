### Best Practices Research

#### Clean Architecture Implementation
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic with no external dependencies
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (file system, AI agents, etc.)
- **Presentation Layer**: CLI interface and command handling

#### Protocol-Oriented Design Patterns
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- **Strategy Pattern**: Interchangeable AI agent implementations
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access layer

#### Test-Driven Development Approach
- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Write failing test, make it pass, refactor
- **Test Categories**: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock external dependencies and AI agents
- **Test Data Management**: Consistent test data and fixtures

#### CLI Design Best Practices
- **Command Structure**: Consistent and intuitive command syntax
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with suggested actions
- **Progress Feedback**: Visual progress indicators for long operations
- **Help System**: Comprehensive help and documentation

### Risk Analysis

#### Technical Risks
- **AI Agent Integration Complexity**: Different AI providers may have varying APIs
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: File I/O and AI agent communication could be slow
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Different file system behaviors across platforms
- **Type Safety**: Complex type definitions for AI agent responses

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **Protocol Abstraction**: Abstract AI agent communication behind interfaces
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement performance metrics and optimization
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Test on multiple platforms during development
- **Type Safety**: Use strict TypeScript configuration and comprehensive types

#### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Complex CLI might have steep learning curve
- **AI Agent Dependencies**: Reliance on external AI services
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Complex architecture might be hard to maintain

#### Mitigation Strategies
- **User Experience**: Focus on intuitive design and comprehensive documentation
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provide local processing when AI agents fail
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality and comprehensive documentation
