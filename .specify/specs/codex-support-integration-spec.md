# Feature Specification: Codex Support Integration

**Description**: Add OpenAI Codex support to UX-Kit CLI with minimal changes, enabling Codex as an AI agent option during initialization and generating appropriate command templates
**Branch**: feature/codex-support-integration
**Created**: 2025-09-19 04:06:52 UTC
**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: P1

## Overview

This feature adds OpenAI Codex support to UX-Kit CLI, allowing users to select Codex as their AI agent during initialization. The implementation follows the same pattern as the existing Cursor integration but generates Codex-specific command templates and validation. This enables UX researchers to leverage Codex's capabilities for their research workflows while maintaining consistency with the existing UX-Kit architecture.

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **AI Agent Selection**: Add 'codex' to the existing AI agent choices in InitCommand
  - **Input**: User selection from AI agent prompt
  - **Output**: Codex option available in selection menu
  - **Business Rules**: Must maintain existing Cursor and custom agent options

- **Command Template Generation**: Create CodexCommandGenerator service similar to CursorCommandGenerator
  - **Input**: Codex selection during initialization
  - **Output**: Codex-specific command templates in templates/codex-commands/
  - **Business Rules**: Templates must follow existing UX-Kit command structure

- **CLI Validation**: Implement Codex CLI availability checking
  - **Input**: System environment check
  - **Output**: Validation status and user feedback
  - **Business Rules**: Graceful fallback when Codex CLI unavailable

- **Template Structure**: Generate Codex-compatible command templates
  - **Input**: Codex integration requirements
  - **Output**: Functional command templates for IDE integration
  - **Business Rules**: Must be compatible with existing template system

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: No impact on existing initialization performance
  - **Metric**: Initialization time
  - **Target**: < 100ms additional overhead

- **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing Cursor and custom agent options
  - **Metric**: Existing functionality preservation
  - **Target**: 100% backward compatibility

- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of Codex CLI unavailability
  - **Metric**: Error recovery rate
  - **Target**: 100% graceful degradation

### Dependencies
- **External**: OpenAI Codex CLI (optional, for validation)
  - **Status**: Optional dependency
  - **Owner**: OpenAI
  - **Timeline**: N/A

- **Internal**: Existing InitCommand, CursorCommandGenerator, InputService
  - **Status**: Available
  - **Owner**: UX-Kit Team
  - **Timeline**: Immediate

## Design Considerations

### User Interface
Codex option appears in the existing AI agent selection prompt with consistent styling and behavior matching existing options. The integration should be seamless and not disrupt the current user experience.

### User Experience
Seamless integration with existing initialization flow, providing clear feedback about Codex integration status and graceful fallback behavior when Codex CLI is not available. Users should be able to switch between AI agents without confusion.

### Accessibility
No changes to existing accessibility features. Maintains keyboard navigation support and screen reader compatibility. All new UI elements follow existing accessibility patterns.

### Performance
Minimal overhead during initialization with no impact on existing command execution. The Codex integration should not slow down the overall UX-Kit performance.

### Security
No additional security considerations beyond existing AI agent handling. Codex integration follows the same security patterns as the current Cursor integration.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Codex Integration
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Goals**: Add Codex support to AI agent selection and validation
- **Deliverables**: 
  - Updated InitCommand with Codex option
  - Codex CLI validation logic
  - Basic Codex command template generation

### Phase 2: Command Template System
- **Duration**: 1 day
- **Goals**: Create comprehensive Codex command templates
- **Deliverables**: 
  - CodexCommandGenerator service
  - Codex-specific command templates
  - Integration with existing template system

### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation
- **Duration**: 1 day
- **Goals**: Ensure quality and update documentation
- **Deliverables**: 
  - Unit tests for Codex integration
  - Updated documentation
  - Integration testing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
Test Codex option in AI agent selection, Codex CLI validation logic, and Codex command template generation. Ensure all new components work independently and handle edge cases properly.

### Integration Testing
Test full initialization flow with Codex selected, fallback behavior when Codex CLI unavailable, and command template generation and placement. Verify end-to-end functionality.

### User Acceptance Testing
Verify Codex appears in selection prompt, Codex command templates are generated correctly, and proper error handling and user feedback. Ensure user experience meets expectations.

### Performance Testing
Measure initialization time impact and ensure no performance regression. Test with and without Codex CLI available.

### Security Testing
Verify no new security vulnerabilities introduced and that Codex integration follows existing security patterns.

## Risks and Considerations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Codex CLI not available | Medium | High | Graceful fallback with clear messaging | Dev Team |
| Template compatibility issues | Low | Medium | Follow existing Cursor template patterns | Dev Team |
| Performance impact | Low | Low | Minimal changes, no new dependencies | Dev Team |
