# UX-Kit Principles

## Spec-Driven Development
UX-Kit follows a specification-driven approach to UX research, ensuring that all research activities are guided by clear objectives and structured methodologies.

## AI Agent Integration
Leverage AI agents (Cursor, Codex, etc.) to enhance research workflows while maintaining human oversight and critical thinking.

## File-Based Approach
All research artifacts are stored as text files, making them easily accessible to AI agents and version control systems.

## Template-Driven Consistency
Use standardized templates to ensure consistent research outputs and facilitate AI agent understanding.

## Lightweight Implementation
Focus on essential functionality without complex data models or inference engines.
