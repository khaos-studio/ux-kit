**Study ID**: 001-e-commerce-checkout-optimization  
**Date**: 2024-01-18  
**Researcher**: Sarah Chen

## Executive Summary

Our research reveals that checkout abandonment is primarily driven by three factors: unexpected costs, forced account creation, and poor mobile experience. Users consistently express frustration with hidden fees, complex forms, and lack of trust signals. The most successful checkout experiences are those that are transparent, fast, and offer guest checkout options.

## Key Findings

### Cost Transparency is Critical

Users abandon carts when shipping costs or taxes are not clearly displayed upfront.

**Evidence**: All three participants mentioned cost-related frustrations, with 2/3 citing it as a primary abandonment reason.

---

### Guest Checkout is Essential

Forced account creation is a major barrier to checkout completion.

**Evidence**: 2/3 participants explicitly stated they abandon carts when account creation is required.

---

### Mobile Experience Needs Improvement

Mobile checkout flows are significantly more frustrating than desktop experiences.

**Evidence**: Mobile users reported lower satisfaction scores (5-6) compared to desktop users (8).

---

### Trust Signals Matter

Users look for security indicators and trust badges before entering payment information.

**Evidence**: All participants mentioned looking for security indicators, with 2/3 citing it as important for completion.
