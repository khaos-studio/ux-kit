**Study ID**: 001-e-commerce-checkout-optimization  
**Date**: 2024-01-18  
**Researcher**: Sarah Chen

## Primary Questions

- What are the main abandonment points in our checkout flow?
- How do users navigate through the multi-step checkout process?
- What information do users find most difficult to provide during checkout?
- How do users respond to different payment options and security indicators?
- What are the key factors that influence checkout completion vs. abandonment?

## Secondary Questions

- How do mobile vs. desktop checkout experiences differ?
- What role do trust signals play in checkout completion?
- How do users handle form validation errors?
- What are users' expectations for checkout speed and efficiency?
- How do promotional codes and discounts affect the checkout flow?

## Context

This study is part of our Q1 2024 initiative to improve e-commerce conversion rates. We've seen a 15% increase in cart abandonment over the past quarter, and initial analytics suggest the checkout flow is a primary contributor.

## Notes

Focus on both quantitative metrics (conversion rates, time to complete) and qualitative insights (user emotions, pain points, expectations).
